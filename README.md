#### As a Computer Scientist, I enjoy collaborating with people from all kinds of backgrounds to find effective solutions to a range of complex problems. I want to work in an exciting and motivated environment with a team that will settle for nothing less than perfection. I strive to write lasting code that is efficient and scalable. I am interested in working either in Boulder/Denver or in Southern California.

## Experience

### Software Engineer , The Donaldson Lab (Boulder, Colorado) May 2019 – Dec 2019

As a software engineer for the lab, I worked with a small team of 10 scientists to study the mechanistic basis for individual
differences in behavior and how these behaviors impact the likelihood to develop mental illness. One project I completed for the lab
is called the UI Lab Capture (see details below). Another project that I am currently working on uses a convolutional neural network
and deep learning to quantify different behaviors displayed by voles.

### I.T. Intern , General Services Agency (Ventura County Government, California) May 2018 - Aug 2018

As an IT intern for GSA, I performed server maintenance, automation, and desktop support throughout the office. My lasting
contribution to the team was my development of PowerShell scripts to automate laborious tasks. I made it a priority to design code
that can be manipulated and used to solve a variety of problems. These scripts contributed to the subtraction of substantial man
hours.

## Projects

### UI Lab Capture May 2019

An interface designed to make the scientists job easier by providing a simple, yet effective way of setting up their cameras and
starting their data collection for experiments. Using a GUI, the user could easily interact with the equipment and adjust settings.
Multithreading and multiprocessing are both used on the backend to ensure the GUI is responsive while also ensuring no data is
being lost during acquisition.

### Excel External Link Editor May 2018

While at GSA, this program was designed and built to delete user-decided links from an excel document. I created EELE to reduce
man hours spent manually deleting every broken link from an overwhelming amount of accounting documents. Working closely with
my “clients”, the accountants at GSA, I took this project under my belt and provided an optimal solution to their problem.
